# InferSharp

**InferSharp** (also referred to as Infer#) is an interprocedural and scalable static code analyzer for C#. Via the capabilities of Facebook's [Infer](https://fbinfer.com/), this tool detects null pointer dereferences and resource leak. Read more about our approach in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/infersharp/wiki/InferSharp).
