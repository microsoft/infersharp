# The "-index-store-path <folder>" argument does not exist in Clang and it gets
# discarded without any error message. The problem is that its argument,
# a folder, is not discarded, and Clang considers it as a source file. This
#Â leads to an error. This weird case can be observed when -index-store-path is
# passed in a sequence like the one in CLANG_OPTIONS.
